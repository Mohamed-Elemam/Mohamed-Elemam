### Real-World QA Experience

I have had the opportunity to apply my QA skills by performing manual testing and user journey validation for live production websites.

- **viola-tv.com**: Conducted end-to-end testing to ensure all user flows worked as intended.
- **tetramediahub.com**: Validated user interface elements and overall site functionality to improve the user experience.

This experience has solidified my passion for QA and my ability to contribute to real-world projects.
